# TDNN
A keras implementation of Peddinti's paper "A time delay neural network architecture for efficient modeling of long  temporal contexts". [Work in progress]

## Using this layer
Add TDNN_layer.py to your project and include TDNN_layer. Then, use TDNN_layer as a Keras layer.

See demo.py for usage example. The file demo.py implements the network described in Peddiniti's paper.

## Performances
The file demo.py implements the network described in Peddiniti's paper "A time delay neural network architecture for efficient modeling of long temporal contexts". I trained the neural network on libri speetch dataset.
[Still in progress]
